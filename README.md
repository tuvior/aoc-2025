A collection of my solutions to **Advent of Code 2025**, written in **Rust**.  
This project serves as a practical way for me to **learn Rust deeply** by solving progressively harder problems using increasingly idiomatic patterns.

Each day follows a shared interface (`Day` trait) and a consistent file structure.

## 🚀 Running

Run a day:

    cargo run -- <day>

Example:

    cargo run -- 1

Run a specific part:

    cargo run -- <day> <part>

Example:

    cargo run -- 1 2

Run all tests:

    cargo test

## 📁 Project Structure

    aoc-2025/
      inputs/
        day01.txt
        day02.txt
        ...
      src/
        main.rs
        lib.rs        // Day trait + generic runner
        days/
          mod.rs
          day01.rs
          day02.rs
          ...

- `lib.rs`: defines the `Day` trait and shared utilities  
- `main.rs`: command-line entrypoint  
- `days/dayXX.rs`: each day's solution

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn **idiomatic Rust**
- Practice:
  - ownership & borrowing  
  - lifetimes (when needed)  
  - iterators & combinators  
  - pattern matching  
  - clean module structures  
  - error handling  
  - testing & benchmarks  
- Solve the puzzles in a clean, readable way  
- Refactor code as Rust knowledge improves
